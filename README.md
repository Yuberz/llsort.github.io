# LLSorter
A Love Live! character true round robin sorter.

## Features
- Every character from Î¼'s to Ikizurai-Bu!
- Has additional data like group preference, blood type preference, and height preference!
- True round robin, providing the most accurate answers possible.
- "Quick" mode which uses transitive relationships to dramatically reduce time required to complete (common with other Love Live character sorters online)
- Uses true randomness to avoid bias (in both modes).

## Caveats
- True round robin takes an immense amount of comparisons (1953 comparisons!)
- Some characters do not have data for blood type (they are ignored on data displays)
- Rival group characters are not included.
- True random makes quick mode slower than other LL sorting websites, but I do not intend to change this.

## TODO
- Maybe add the rival groups (would take only a few minutes but I'm lazy)
- Maybe add supporting characters
- Fix UI to not show remaining matches
- Add an undo button (oops)

## Credits
- All images are pulled from the [Love Live Wiki](https://love-live.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) in order to have a consistent appearance.
